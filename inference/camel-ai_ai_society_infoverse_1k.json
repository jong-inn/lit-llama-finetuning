This is especially evident on the International Space Station (ISS), where the crew has to use as much space as possible for essential systems. To compensate for this, sleeping quarters, lounges, gyms, and other recreational areas are often built into the station in separate modules. The crew then uses these areas during their off-duty hours, and the rest of the station is left empty. However, due to the small size of spacecraft, crew members often have to sleep in shifts and cramp themselves into the sleeping quarters. This results in crew members being awake at all times, leading to increased fatigue and stress. Because of this, sleeping quarters on space stations are often designed to be more spacious and comfortable. Additionally, the cramped conditions of early space stations like Salyut"}

{"output": "The unconventional tuning system used in handcrafted violins is based on the relative pitch between the notes played and the notes the violin produces through its own means. The violin is placed under tuning forks or a piano or electronic keyboard that produces the note to be played, and the violin is turned to produce a note that is harmonically consistent with the one produced by the tuning fork. This method is generally used for students learning violin as it allows them to quickly identify the correct note to play, but this does not guarantee the pitch of the violin will be accurate, as it depends on the person turning the violin creating the correct pitch for the student."}
