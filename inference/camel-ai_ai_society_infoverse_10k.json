It is important to provide ongoing support to the families, regardless of whether or not the mothers participate in the play sessions. This support can be provided in a variety of ways (e.g., providing free childcare during play sessions, inviting the mothers to participate in regular social events, developing a mentorship program, encouraging the mothers to seek additional support and resources).\n\nThe specific nature and scope of the ongoing support and resources you provide will depend on your local context and the needs of the families that you are working with. Work closely with the mothers to identify potential barriers that may prevent them from accessing additional support and resources (e.g., a lack of transportation, a lack of childcare options, difficulty navigating complex systems or bureaucracies).

This is a good sign that you have successfully engaged the muscles of your middle and top vocal ranges and are singing softly. As you sing, keep your eyes closed and listen to the sound of your voice more than anything else. \n\nOnce you are able to sing softly in head voice at the very top of your range, try singing softly"}

This is because derivatives can be used to lock in a price and hedge against future changes in the price of an asset. For example, a trader might purchase a call option on shares of a company. By doing so, the trader is hedging against an increase in the price of the stock in the future. Since the trader owns the call option, they can sell the option for a profit if the price of the stock increases."}
